1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interest topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning 
about the various types of GNN structures that are being widely used in 
the NN field and their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, I 
thought it was very interesting how each structure varied in the way 
information was carried/stored.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your 
Quarter 2 Project.

One potential investigation I might like to pursue for my Quarter 2 
Project is pitching the merging of mutltiple GNN structures together to 
optimise how information is passed. For example, if CNNs have advantage x, 
we can investigate how to integrate that into a new model, while also 
incorporating elements from GATs, etc.

3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your 
current Quarter 1 Project?

Currently, we have not made significant progress on our Quarter 1 project, 
and therefore do not have a tangible idea for what we want to submit by 
the end of the quarter. However, we will make sure to remain scrutious 
about our proposal so that we can make any necessary changes before we 
continue on with our Quarter 2 project.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

We would be interesting in using benchmark datasets of various sizes in 
the implementation of our project. We noticed recently that the majority 
of graph benchmark datasets are smaller, but if we truly want to optimise 
Long Range Interactions of GNNs, we should consider graph datasets that 
are more diverse in size so that we can test the model on a larger scale 
as well and see how it performs.
